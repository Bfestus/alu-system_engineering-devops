# Project Name

## Overview

This project is aimed at providing information and guidelines related to servers, SSH, and secure connections.

## Servers

A server is a dedicated computer or system that manages network resources and provides services to other computers (clients). Servers can be located in data centers, server rooms, or in the cloud.

## SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure communication over an unsecured network. It is commonly used for remote access to servers and secure file transfers.

## Creating an SSH RSA Key Pair

To create an SSH RSA key pair, use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
