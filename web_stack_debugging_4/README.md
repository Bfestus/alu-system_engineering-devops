# Debugging Nginx Web Server Under Pressure

## Introduction
In this web stack debugging task, we are assessing the performance of our web server setup featuring Nginx under high pressure, and the results indicate a significant number of failed requests. To address this issue, we will utilize ApacheBench, a widely used tool for simulating HTTP requests to a web server.

## Benchmarking Details
For benchmarking, we are employing ApacheBench to simulate 2000 requests to the server with 100 requests executed concurrently. The current outcome reveals 943 failed requests. The goal is to optimize our stack and minimize the failed requests, recognizing the importance of logs in troubleshooting.

## Debugging Strategies

### 1. Log Analysis
   - Thoroughly inspect Nginx error logs for any error messages or warnings.
   - Analyze access logs to gather information on incoming requests and potential issues.

### 2. ApacheBench Analysis
   - Review ApacheBench output for specific error codes or patterns.
   - Adjust ApacheBench parameters for further testing and analysis.

### 3. Nginx Configuration
   - Check Nginx configuration files for misconfigurations or limitations.
   - Adjust server settings, buffers, and timeouts to accommodate the high-pressure scenario.

### 4. Resource Utilization
   - Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) during benchmark testing.
   - Optimize server resources to handle the specified load more efficiently.

### 5. Server Scaling
   - Evaluate the possibility of scaling server resources or employing load balancing to distribute incoming requests effectively.

### 6. Code Review
   - Examine application code to identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - Optimize code for better performance under high loads.

### Conclusion
By following these debugging strategies, we aim to identify and address the root causes of the high number of failed requests, ultimately optimizing our Nginx web server setup for improved performance.
